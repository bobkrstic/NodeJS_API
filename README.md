# NodeJS_API

This is a cheat sheet app, created to be a quick reference for full stack development. Hosted on Heroku, but not intended to be presentable or used to show my skills. You will most likely not be able to access it the right way. You can however look at the code and I think it can be very usefull. Please feel free to browse around. Cheers.
